      title: "About Me",
      content_part1: `I was born in Adorjan, in a small village on the bank of the river Tisza. Even as a child I grew on to the water and nature. At that time Tisa was all our entertainment, because we couldn't find anything else. There were no TVs, computers, laptops...`,
      content_part2: `My first fishing trip ties me up here. The first steps I took with my father. The rod made of ash tree, goose feather floats, ‘’Turtle’’- line: 0.30, large hook, and we went straight to the water. Later, fishing has become part of my everyday life. Since then, the joy of catch, catching fish and love of nature has become part of me. It determines my daily life.`,
      content_part3: `"Without water there is no life!"- Teachers taught us in school, but we, being children from the village, have already knew that very well! We understood that it's not relevant where we are in the world, but the important thing is to have water all around us.`,
      content_part4: `I started to compete later, when I grew up. Already, on the first competition, I was fascinated by the power of success. There I learned that the details have to be “accurately refined”, and a lot of tricks, which carried me forward. With those I have amassed success upon success. Of course, the lot of time that I spent on water, and what I experienced there, helped me a lot. Now, I know how to "read" all the vibrations of the water, how does the changing of seasons influence the movement of fish and their behaviour. Well, I good remembered the words of my father:`,
      content_part5: `- Walk with open eyes, nature will tell you everything!`,
      content_part6: `Rods: carbon pole, telescopic, Match, Bologna etc. are all the basic equipment for float fishing. Fishing for minnow-type fish are among the most interesting, and the most successful for me, because those fish are the most common. Perhaps, this method gives to fisherman the most success and greatest results. In today's modern conditions, we have to mention, fishing with feeder-rod is became the rival to the float method.`,
      content_part7: `Never wanted only the small fish, so I learned fishing with boilie (small boiled pasta pellets), or - carp fishing. It was a big challenge to patiently manoeuver until the carp gets tired, and then pull it, because forcing could lead to the loss of catch. Learn about how to make boilie at home was also important, because you wouldn’t have to buy good quality, but expensive boilies. It isn’t  theasy to make such of any kind, which carp gladly takes.`,
      content_part8: `Spin fishing. At this time, it is one of my most favourite method of fishing. In our natural/open waters there are less and less predators, and they are all more and more difficult to find and deceive to bite. There are so many types of lures: jigs, spinners, spoons, soft plastic baits, plugs, spinerbaits, flies etc. Certainly, they are all excellent quality, and it isn’t an easy task to choose the most successful one. Which behaves like a little fish? Which color makes them better? Imitating the movements of a small fish, and that the predator believes it tоo!?­­So we can say: that is a true "Art of fishing"!`,
